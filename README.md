click-drag
==========

Click and drag images to swap their positions with another image!

Instructions:
* Click on an image and try dragging it around
* While still being dragged, the end point of your cursor will determine the location of where the image will be dropped onto

```
-- This calculation of where to drop uses Square Boundary Collision Detection. 
-- See app/scripts/main.js for this algorithm
```
